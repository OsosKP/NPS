# NPS
V 0.0 (Intro)
Practice/warmup project using MVC to learn how to pull JSON data from the web and rehost it.
Data is of US National Parks from the NPS at: https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/
(Note: API is inaccessible without a key)

V 0.1
Most pages are now functional, though "Explore" is barebones. More pages will be added eventually. "About" pages also needs to be tweaked to have more information.

Not particularly useful in any way at the moment.
